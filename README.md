A Monokai theme for Jupyterlab.

Adapted from Jupyterlab-theme-dark, [BurglarBenson's Atom One Dark](https://userstyles.org/styles/161189/jupyter-lab-atom-one-dark), and CodeMirror Monokai

Set jupyterlab theme to dark and text editor theme to zenburn to replace with Monokai colors.

Tested using Firefox with Stylus.
